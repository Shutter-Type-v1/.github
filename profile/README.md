# shutter-type-lab

shutter-type.lab is the repository for Shutter Type photoschematic/photo business machine electroplate based business particles and nucleus files. Shutter Type is a Monotype typeface to optimize data consistancy that features extensible inline identifiers designed exclusively for [Billfold Technologies B-Series](https://github.com/Billfold-Technologies/B-Series) and compatible Beamology compatible applications.

May be used with Eusedat Autofocus for Shutter Type typeface. 
Includes:
| Scope | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Symbol Indexer | Node sheet client data ware house of stock symbol business machine serial boxes
| Eusedat Prime Lens (Depth of Field Engine) | Order indicator digital DoF lens for business machine serial boxes
| Light Scheme OCR Lens | Document based lens for business machine serial boxes
| Photo Business Machines Sensor Lens | Node sheet parsing lens for business machine serial boxes
| Algorithmic Autofocus with Lens Dater | Algorithm parsing lens for business machine serial boxes
| Typeface Markup Lens | Render engine for the shuttertype document lens for business machine serial boxes
| Shutter Physics Multi-Layer Lens | Balancing sensor and derailleur lens for business machine serial boxes

Summary technical analysis related data is parsed using:
| Scope | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Start: | The price at opening bell
| Target: | The consensus price movement
| Average: | The price average between two periods
| Percent Change: | The plus or minus move price
| Last: | The last price before current price
| End Yesterday: | The price at yesterday close
| Stop: | The final price at closing bell


Content is categorized per scoped schema as noted below:

| Scope | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Solution | Solutions are the particles and materials used to build business machines |
| Executable | Executables are schematic assets built to optimize technical analysis |
| License | License classes grant permissions to use business particles and machines |
| Platform | Platforms are trade evaluation suggestions based upon analytical data |
| API | API's are dashboards for snippets and developers to pass parameters via CLI |
| Terminal | Terminals are notebooks for testing and calibrating business machines |
| Server | Servers are network switchers that communicate machine language |

Each tier is deployed via stored (daemons: subroutines created by Coalescence) or service (executables: fintech vendor created) grades.  

  
| Command | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Build file name: | 'rbm-filename-st_electroplate' | 
|  Repository: | [electroplate-lab](https://github.com/Shutter-Type-v1/electroplate-lab/) | 
|  Access token: | OAuth | 
|  Nucleus class: | electroplate.lab | 
|  Deployment name: | `npm install` electroplate-lab | 
|  Order: ([https://github.com/Shutter-Type-v1/Technical-Orders](https://github.com/Shutter-Type-v1/Shutter-Type-)) | nucleus type particle | 
|  Node Home: | 'rbm-electroplatelab/filename-st' | 

  

The nucleus class establishes and sets the CLI. The Render Business Machines (RBM) motherboard hosts seven class series daughterboards and their business particles. The classes naming convention follows the build filename. A directory of classes may be found here:
